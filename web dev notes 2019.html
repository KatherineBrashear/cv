notes


html

*** section header tags
<h1></h1>
goes up to six. bigger is 1, smaller is 6.
go in order, don't skip around
important for accessibility

*** the boilerplate for every HTML5 file
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>


*** how to comment
<!-- here is a comment
-->


*** how to center
DEPRECATED, AVOID: <center>
 - instead use CSS to center


*** explain <meta charset="utf-8">
utf-8 is the most up to date character interpreter, has all the languages
 - unicode


*** title
<title></title>
what goes between the tags will be displayed on the tab


*** head
<head></head>
contains the metadata for the document

*** body
<body></body>
there is only one body
has the content for the page, most things go here


*** html
<html></html>
tells the browser it's html
the "root" tag (top-level element) that all others descend from


*** paragraph
<p></p>
makes a paragraph


*** horizontal rule
<hr>
self-closing, makes a horizontal line
can use fancier stuff to adjust

*** line break
<br>
good for line breaks in poems or addresses


*** italics
<em></em>
usually you will want to use em
but <i></i> may sometimes be appropriate
- it's a matter of semantics
- case by case basis


*** bold
<strong></strong>
vs
<b></b>
usually you will want to use strong
but <b></b> may sometimes be appropriate
- it's a matter of semantics
- case by case basis


*** lists
bullet points:
"unordered list"
<ul>
  <li>blah</li>
  <li>whee</li>
</ul>

numbered list
"ordered list"
<ol>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
</ol>


*** add image to webpage
<img src="image path goes here...the source" alt="alternative text if image fails to load, good for accessibility">
you can pull an image path from an image online but you're relying on that website always being up
so a more reliable way would be to save the image, give it a good memorable name, and add it to the document
then the name of the image would be what you'd put in the source instead of an image path to another website


*** add a link
to another page in the website
or
to a page on a different website
<a href="#"></a>
the link goes where the hashtag is
to link to another page in the website, create another page(file) at the same level as the others...
...(index, hobbies, and contact me would all be on one level)
and so put the name of the desired page where the hashtag is to create a link to another page


*** create a table
there's some variability here
use a caption element immediately following the table element
so why would you want to use thead and tbody and tfoot?
you may wish to style each piece differently with CSS. voila.

you can use a table to put an image and text side by side

tr is table row
td is table data or table cell



<table>
  <caption>text describing the table here</caption>

</table>

example pulled from MDN
<p>Table with thead, tfoot, and tbody</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header content 1</th>
      <th>Header content 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Footer content 1</td>
      <td>Footer content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>


*** forms and inputs
inputs are self-closing
define the input type with the type attribute
so this can be buttons, sliders, color pickers, submit forms, etc.
<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="" value="">
</form>
* write a message in the form box
<textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80"></textarea>
the rows are how tall
the columns are how wide
* email form
<input type="email" name="yourEmail" value="">
the input type email gives some basic checking to see if it's an actual email in the field
* example
<form class="" action="mailto:crescentwinter@gmail.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
  <label>Your Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="yourName" value=""><br>
  <label>Your Email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="yourEmail" value=""><br>
  <label>Your Message:</label><br>
  <textarea name="yourMessage" rows="10" cols="30"></textarea><br>
  <input type="submit" name="">
